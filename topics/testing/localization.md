# Localization Testing

🧠 What it is:
Testing the app in different languages, date formats, and currencies to ensure UI adapts correctly.

🎯 Purpose:
Guarantee global usability.

⚙️ Tools:
- `Jest` + `i18n` mock tests
- `Cypress` multi-locale tests
- `Pseudo-localization tools`

💻 Example:
- Verify that switching from English to Arabic mirrors layout (RTL).
