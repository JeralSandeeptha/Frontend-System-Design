# Regression Testing

🧠 What it is:
- Re-testing existing features after code changes to ensure no new bugs were introduced.

🎯 Purpose:
- Prevent breaking previously working code during updates or refactoring.

⚙️ Tools:
- `Jest` (with snapshots)
- `Cypress` regression suites
- Visual regression: `Percy`, `Applitools`, `Chromatic`

💻 Example:
- Ensure the homepage UI looks identical before and after a CSS refactor.
