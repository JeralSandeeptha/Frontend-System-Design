# Performance Optimization

Performance is crucial for frontend applications.

### Key Optimization Techniques:
- ✅ `Lazy Loading` → Load components only when needed.
- ✅ `Code Splitting` → Split large JS bundles into smaller chunks.
- ✅ `Memoization` → Use React.memo, useMemo, useCallback to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- ✅ `Reduce Repaints` & Reflows → Optimize CSS changes, use will-change property.
- ✅ `Optimize Images` → Use WebP format, lazy load images.
- ✅ `Service Workers` → Cache assets for faster page loads.
