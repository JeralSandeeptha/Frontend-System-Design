# API Handling and Data Fetching

Frontend systems interact with the backend via APIs.

### Types of API Communication:
- `REST API` → Standard JSON-based communication.
- `GraphQL API` → Fetch only the required data (great for complex apps).
- `WebSockets` → Real-time communication (used in chat apps).
- `gRPC` → High-performance APIs for microservices.

### Best Practices:
✔️ Use Axios or fetch for API calls.
✔️ Implement error handling (try...catch).
✔️ Use pagination, caching, and lazy loading for efficiency.
