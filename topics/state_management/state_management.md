# State Management

Managing state is crucial for a scalable frontend system.

1. Local State (Component-level state)

- Managed using useState in React.
- Global State (Shared across multiple components)

2. Context API – Lightweight, good for small apps.

- Redux – Centralized store, good for large apps.
- Recoil / Zustand – Alternative lightweight state managers.

3. Server State (Remote data fetched from APIs)

- React Query, SWR – Helps manage caching and API fetching efficiently.
