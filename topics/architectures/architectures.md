# Frontend Architectures

Frontend architecture defines how a web application is structured, ensuring modularity, reusability, and scalability.

1. Monolithic Frontend

- All UI components and logic exist in a single repository.
- Example: Traditional MVC frameworks (Angular, old React apps).

2. Micro Frontends

- Different parts of the UI are developed and deployed independently.
- Example: Different teams own separate modules (React for one, Vue for another).

3. Server-Driven UI

- The backend dictates the UI structure dynamically.
- Example: GraphQL-powered frontends, React Native with Backend-driven UI.

4. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
- Web apps that behave like native mobile apps with offline support.
